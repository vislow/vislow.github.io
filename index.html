    <h3 class="blogTitle">I think I know what to do</h3>
    <p>I have been lost recently on what to do in life but I think I have figured out a solution or, at least, the start to a solution. First of all, I started reading Atomic Habits and let me say—surprise, surprise, this book is very insightful. It's become very popular and has been one of the go to book recommendations in the past few years and sorta just felt like a TikTok book recommendation sorta like TikTok song recommendations, it felt like it might suck. I stand corrected. I will also point out that I didn't start reading until about a month ago. I started reading while spending time in Hiwasa, Japan at the Ichi Hostel as Hiwasa is a quiet town and there wasn't usually a ton to do. Couple that with the urge to stop consuming so much and start creating more, expand my knowledge, lea

    <h3 class="blogTitle">I dont know what to do</h3>
    <p>I'm lost. I've recently thought about giving up on computer science. It feels like such a losing battle to do anything at this point. I know there are systems out there still using cobalt, php, and windows 96 but with new frameworks and languages every day it feels so overwhelming and especially with AI being pushed so heavily every career path related to computer science has it being pushed somewhere in the line and that kinda sucks. I want programming to be a craft I master. Maybe this is selfishness, I can't tell. Perhaps for some technologies that work to benefit the greater good AI could be used to speed up the process but for most projects I just want to enjoy the process of making the thing and solving the problems. Maybe this is a "ai doomer" mindset that I've developed. I d

    <h3 class="blogTitle">i hate ai</h3>
    <p>im tired and im being hyperbolic but in short, i hate ai. Its everywhere and it pisses me off. I want it out of my life or more realistically I want it to be regulated. I can't escape it. If you use the internet, you interact with AI. I try to research things constantly and even with adblockers and alternate search engines I constantly get hit with AI garbage. Any technology I try to research has hundreds of top 10 articles clearly written by AI, forums are filled with AI questions and AI answers, im sure a lot of the documentation I read is AI too. I hate it. Sometimes I even have to resort to using an AI to aggregate search results and answer a simple fucking question because the results on google or bing or whatever the fuck else are just filled with garbage. the internet fucking

    <h3 class="blogTitle">Among the olive trees</h3>
    <h5>Conversations</h5><p>I've always wanted to be great or rather one of 'the greats', not famous in a modern media sense, not rich and in a fancy house. I want to do something historic and I want to be remembered for something largely influential on society. As well said in the movie Whiplash, I'd rather die drunk and broke at 35 and have people talk about me at the dinner table than live to be rich and sober at 90 and nobody remember who I was. I want to be talked about at dinner tables when I’m long past my expiration, to delay the inevitability of fading into obscurity as all things eventually do. Sometimes I wish I believed in a god, maybe it would dissolve my existential anxieties of time and afterlife, or lack there of, in my mind. I do welcome the possibility of it as I could be wr
