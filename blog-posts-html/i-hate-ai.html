            <h3 class="blogTitle">i hate ai</h3>
            <div class="blogBody"><br><p>im tired and im being hyperbolic but in short, i hate ai. Its everywhere and it pisses me off. I want it out of my life or more realistically I want it to be regulated. I can't escape it. If you use the internet, you interact with AI. I try to research things constantly and even with adblockers and alternate search engines I constantly get hit with AI garbage. Any technology I try to research has hundreds of top 10 articles clearly written by AI, forums are filled with AI questions and AI answers, im sure a lot of the documentation I read is AI too. I hate it. Sometimes I even have to resort to using an AI to aggregate search results and answer a simple fucking question because the results on google or bing or whatever the fuck else are just filled with garbage. the internet fucking sucks now.</p><br><p>I don't know if other people have this problem but I just woke up with a crazy different perspective than when I went to bed earlier. I started studying Q# and cryptography, genuinely motivated to possibly make my way into the quantum cryptography field. I don't care anymore. All interest is gone. I'm tired. I just want something to work out for me. I just want to do something fulfilling, my whole life I have been heavily invested in tech, programming, and computer science but I feel myself slowly losing interest in it because everything related to it has become such a fucking battle. Either you use AI or you don't and if you don't then you're gonna be behind in some aspect at least career wise. I don't like that. It makes me sad. at the end of the day, what is the point. great. an ai made your website, an ai wrote your essay, an ai made your thumbnail, an ai made your script, an ai trained on your voice narrated it for you. it all comes down to greed. for people who know more than a surface level about ai. I dont mean all ai, like i said, im being hyberbolic. There is a different type of ai that detects alzheimers and there is a different type of ai that used to kill you in video games. Obviously, im talking about large language models. Even in the rural countryside Japan, even in the mountains of Vietnam, I can't escape AI. LLMs have very specific use cases that are justifiable to me but most of the time that reason for using ai is because search engines have become so inefficient and so inconvenient that you need a tool to till the wasteland for you. Most of the time I struggle to trust it anyways though considering how the majority of the internet is now ai generated and there is undeniably a flaw in the fundamental process on which LLMs function when it comes to searching topics that aren't quite general, the more niche you get the worse the answers are. I went to use ChatGPT to help explain a feature of Q# and it produced code that was simply wrong. I know thats low hanging fruit and ChatGPT isn't a coding specific LLM so I shouldn't expect much but, that refreshes my perspective on how it can be wrong and biased. It was incredibly confident in its answer and I even corrected it. It replied with the generic, "Good catch! You're right" then proceeded to still produce an incorrect answer. The problem is, programming is definitive. There is a specific way to write things, you have syntax you have to abide by and in cases like these its easy to spot the mistake. Now think about simply answering a question you aren't already an expert on, there is no standard syntax it has to abide by. It writes you an answer in good ol plain ol english and you accept whatever it says especially if you lack some knowledge in the topic. One of my biggest problems with people that use LLMs is if you receive an answer that feels off and either and your solution isn't to question it but to instead question your own understanding then you are failing yourself. Even worse is if you get an incorrect response and resort to saying "Hey I think that answer was wrong" then you lost and I think you have a misunderstanding of how the LLM works. Its ok not to know how these things work, but I think you should learn because AI literacy is very very important for your future and the worlds. Do not simply take everything an LLM says at face value. When I say LLM I refer to ChatBot like tools ie ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Grok, etc. AAAAAHAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH i need to sleep. </p></div>
