            <h3 class="blogTitle">Awa Dance Festival</h3>
            <div class="blogBody"><br><p>Today was the Awa Dance Festival in Tokushima, Japan. Awa being the old name for Tokushima and thusly what the traditional dance style is named after. It is also one of the allotted two days off work this week. The festival was basically a bigger version of the festival I saw in Hiwasa last month and considering it’s a two hour drive from the Olive Farm I wasn’t hesitant to go as I have many projects I’m working on at the moment. I haven’t been away from the farm since arriving early this month so I thought I should just go. Oki-San, the owner of the aptly named Oki Olive Farm, cafe, and guest house, gave me and the other volunteers (couple from Argentina) some of his Yukata to wear (A yukata is the summer version of a Kimono) which personally I would not wear out of my own volition considering I’m a white guy with a minuscule understanding of Japanese culture with the exception of Yukata aren’t actually worn, or even owned, by all that many Japanese people unless you’re wearing it as a performer of the event. You’ll see a few people here and there but in some places you might be more likely to see tourists wearing kimono or yukata over actual Japanese citizens. The majority of Japanese people don’t wear it, so I feel weird but I digress. It feels rude to not wear it when offered, especially since Oki-San was wearing his as well.</p></div>
