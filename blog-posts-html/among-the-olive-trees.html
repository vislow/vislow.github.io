            <h3 class="blogTitle">Among the olive trees</h3>
            <div class="blogBody"><h5>Conversations</h5><p>I've always wanted to be great or rather one of 'the greats', not famous in a modern media sense, not rich and in a fancy house. I want to do something historic and I want to be remembered for something largely influential on society. As well said in the movie Whiplash, I'd rather die drunk and broke at 35 and have people talk about me at the dinner table than live to be rich and sober at 90 and nobody remember who I was. I want to be talked about at dinner tables when I’m long past my expiration, to delay the inevitability of fading into obscurity as all things eventually do. Sometimes I wish I believed in a god, maybe it would dissolve my existential anxieties of time and afterlife, or lack there of, in my mind. I do welcome the possibility of it as I could be wrong, I won't pretend to fully understand the universe.</p><br><p>That is to say, as I sit here among the olive trees in the mountains of Takamatsu, Japan—the sun beaming down at 40°C, the sweat pouring down my face so much so that my shirt is fully saturated; I want nothing more than to be here, tilling the fields, weeding the base of the trees, listening to the cicadas speak. Two months ago I would’ve told you cicadas are annoying and should be killed. I’ve changed my mind—they are welcome to fill the silence as I'm sure their conversations are far more interesting than mine...that kinda makes me sound schizophrenic...I digress.  So, as I sit here relatively broke, sober, and alone—no indication of conversational (and definitely not historical) relevance, I am content. If a shooting star were to stream over head, a free wish would pass me by.</p><br><p>I'm not sure if it's naive or optimistic to think I could possibly do something so influential to society as to occupy the minds of people I will never meet but I will say whether or not it happens, I'm surely at an early stage of finding out and this place has been an great environment for progress.</p><h5>Anxiety</h5><p>While lying under a tree to take a break from work I had made the realization that I wasn't anxious, nervous, or depressed in the slightest and hadn't been all day or even much at all in the past month in hindsight. That felt weird because I’m almost always anxious and overthinking, it’s my nature and I struggle to dissuade it as it's very deeply ingrained in my subconscious (that's a topic for another day). Today however, my only anxiety came from the brief moment I was awoken by loud footsteps, seemingly with no source, in my room at 4:00am before I realized it was (most likely) a raccoon who had gotten under the floorboards. The realization only hit me so quick because the same thing happened at 11:00pm the night prior which was pretty fun actually. I don’t believe in ghosts but considering I am staying in a 120 year old home I felt the need to suspend my disbelief for a moment and pretend it was the ghost of Fujiwara (the previous owner) coming to expel the foreigners from his home as I peeked in empty rooms, closets, and the admittedly very scary attic looking for evidence of a demon of some kind as that’s far more exciting than a raccoon. I am a big fan of raccoons though, they are very cool and cute.</p><br><p>Back to the mental discussion. I recently deactivated my social medias which was something I've been putting off for a long time, making excuses like I need it for my photography business or I need it to talk to people. No I don't. I had a website where people could learn about me and my business, see my photos, and contact me through email or a thousand other messaging apps. Sure there is a small chance some person or company see's my photos on social media and decides to hire me for some life changing job but I'm not an influencer nor am I a business man meaning I don't post Instagram reels to keep up with trends, I don't post gear unboxing's to show off my new gear, and I don't like posting things that feel fake or performative. I take photos that I think are interesting and I post them. </p></div>
