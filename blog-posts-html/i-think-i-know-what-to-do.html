            <h3 class="blogTitle">I think I know what to do</h3>
            <div class="blogBody"><br><p>I have been lost recently on what to do in life but I think I have figured out a solution or, at least, the start to a solution. First of all, I started reading Atomic Habits and let me sayâ€”surprise, surprise, this book is very insightful. It's become very popular and has been one of the go to book recommendations in the past few years and sorta just felt like a TikTok book recommendation sorta like TikTok song recommendations, it felt like it might suck. I stand corrected. I will also point out that I didn't start reading until about a month ago. I started reading while spending time in Hiwasa, Japan at the Ichi Hostel as Hiwasa is a quiet town and there wasn't usually a ton to do. Couple that with the urge to stop consuming so much and start creating more, expand my knowledge, learn more, etc etc. I just want to use my brain and do cool things. I read Cats Cradle, most of The Inner Game of Tennis (it gets really repetitive and the main point of the book is a concept I believe I've already come to understand for myself, the author even confirms it at one point), and now Atomic Habits. While the motivation to change and better myself has always been there and only grows as time passes, this book has really been getting me over that edge. I'll cut to the chase here. I've come to really believe in myself which is a new development for me as I've always had confidence issues. I actually believe I can do just about anything I want to with time and effort. Atomic Habits hasn't been the only reason for this and I think lots of other books, read around the same time as this one, could have the same impact. I have two main projects I plan to pursue, one already being in the process. My game Glyph and my game studio Strange Depths, as well as a blog/video essay/article/guide production...thing. I'm not quite sure what to classify this thing as to be honest but I'd like to start a YouTube channel and my personal website where I can make videos and write blogs about things I find interesting that I would like to research and talk about. I thought of a few different names but I'm not entirely sure if I like them yet; subjectively objective, subject valentine, subjectively valentine, or overthought thoughts. I think all these names could work and I shouldn't stress about it too hard but this would be technically separate from Vislow Media as that is solely for photography and videography but who knows maybe I change it. I want to be anonymous at the start though or at least out of the eyes of the people I know because frankly I need a way to stop feeling like people I know are judging me, it's a problem I have and I need to get over it, I will, I am. Anyway, the writings and videos would be on topics such as ethical AI usage, how or if you can be objective, why you should learn math and programming at the same time, how programming is easier than it seems but its tedious, and that's all I've got at the moment to be honest but I know I've had more topics I'd love to research and make videos on.</p></div>
